{"prompt":"Write an analysis of the song ”As it was” by Harry Styles, but refer to Harry as Sir Harold Styles. ->\n\n###\n\n","completion":" All of us live in the past no matter our intent to do otherwise.  In his chronological reflection, Sir Harold Styles’ provides a kaleidoscope of perspectives of the past.   Yet, the one most finite is that the constant romanticization of the past is as immovable as time itself.. Styles begins with the most romanticized visions of life, childhood innocence and adolescent infallibility.   A child, or possible sibling only wanting to wish Harold good night to introduce the song takes Styles back to what he used to only live for as a child, a comforting good night.   The first stanza begins with hyperbolic naivety when Styles claims only ”gravity” holds him back.  The metaphorical gravity for Harold appears to be a lost love interest.  The first pangs experienced for many.  Styles introduces a pacifying question, “why can’t we leave it at that” in order to both move on and segue into the chorus that claims, “it’s just us” but neither the relationship or the ever changing present  remains the same. The second stanza relies almost entirely on Styles’s internal monologue with himself.  In contrast from the first stanza’s longing for good night, Styles is longing for help.  This transparency might symbolize his own difficulties with abuse or he put himself in this dark light to help others cope with disparaging times or relationships. Styles’s riddling of the chorus’s claim about the past, “you know it’s not the same as it was” mimics the epiphany he has experienced in the poem, a constant evolution he  must cope with in his own relationships with those close to him and time itself.  Though possibly unintended, Styles seems to have clung on to the final line of F. Scott Fitzgerald’s, The Great Gatsby.\n"}

{"prompt":"Write an essay about the rhetorical choices used in the book Slaughterhouse Five, by Kurt Vonnegut. ->\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Billy traveled to 1997 where a female human being named Madeline Albright, who was very successful in a job dominated by male human beings delivered a speech to a group of younger female human beings who had just finished all their schooling.  As with most college graduates, they were ready to go out and conquer the world or at least land a sweet job and a soothing life in a cul-de-sac.  The younger females had gone to an all girls school and probably had not experienced the same inequalities sometimes found at normal schools.  They might have a one dimensional perception about some of the mean stuff that could be facing them in the future.  This woman was there to tell them this and much more.  She chose not only to inspire these women as most speeches like this go, but provide a cautionary explanation of the complacency that can parallel success, harness with them the responsibility of the feminist movement forefront, and inspire them to not despair in the ugly, masculine face of discrimination they will most certainly experience (because the Albright Lady did too). According to Albright, these women must “shoot for the moon” surrounded by misogynistic meteors. Albright chooses to begin her oration by providing a choice of existence for the women to live by; “narrow, selfish, complacent” or with “courage and faith.” I am not touching the “right to choose” implication, so I am going with this.  The ability for women to have a choice and navigate their own lives is only a generation or three old no matter what legal boundaries have been lifted.  Societal and cultural norms have limited women in the past, and when given a chance to pursue a future they decide, it has been met with similar inequities of other marginalized groups. As Secretary of State and responsible for America’s diplomacy and foreign affairs, Albright allows her audience to peer into her global scope related to America’s influence on the world to either instill nationaistic pride, tout the political prowess of the president and his cabinet, garner the allegiance of some younger, impressionistic voters, or\/but her main purpose relates to the litany of contemporary examples of American success with a consistent  use of repetition of how successful times breed a justification for complacency…like after graduating from stupid school or whatever (please spell repetition correctly).  The American mentality of  “success should create more want for success” examples relate to the needs of the current feminst movement as well as the importance of instilling this mentality into younger, educated women’s minds, rather than a bunch of old Karen’s wielding their crabby might. As she finishes patting America on the back, she recognizes the “enormous advances”of women and to not to ingest it as a sedative; an immediate link to the purpose of her American praise. The vastness of these examples mimics what Albright foresees in her audience. Not just one example of success, but several, and with each: never to relax, turn their back, or stop. Before leading into the broad scope of personal examples she has witnessed as leader in our foreign affairs, she alludes to Lucy Wassmuth’’s quote as Holoyoke being the home of the uncommon women. Now what boundless, fruitful, college graduate wants to leave a legacy of commonality? I don’t really like rhetorical questions, but this works ok. The four global, diverse examples or anecdotes of women from all over the world serve to inspire these educated women to play their role in what is a much less precarious circumstance in comparison to what these graduates face. The diverse examples also instill a confidence of women in the audience from various cultures, and guide her audience to this same altruistic path of service for their own country or community. With another four paragraphs Albright serves as soothsayer in prophesying the “ridicule and challenge” each woman in the audience will face. Again, Albright has certainly endured it herself and many college female graduates may have not faced it all yet, no matter the educational institution.  Beyond the bigotry caution, Albright warns of societal traps of family or employment deterring these women from their chosen purpose. These traps are just as responsible for inhibiting women in the past as they yield or concede to norms passed down. Albright ends with broad use of the word “faith” by not solely limiting its meaning to divine intervention to decide the women’s fate (maybe to not bind under the umbrella of Christianity as many speakers do, sorry Easter bunny).  What Albright deems most important in the connotation of the word faith is faith in the halls of the institutions that just prepared you for this journey, faith in your courage, your perseverance, and the faith that what you commit your existence to your life to on this earth is worth doing. \n"}
{"prompt":"Write an essay about the character Moses in the book The Known World by Edward P Jones.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The depiction of slavery is normally etched in scars and shackles and death.  But Edward P. Jones The Known World offers a glimpse into the life of a slave named Moses during a time of reflection, routine, and catharsis.  Jones creates Moses through biblical allusions, a third person objective point of view, imagery related to all five of Moses’s senses, and a chronicle of physical gestures to reveal the coping mechanisms of slavery as well as possible when a slave struggles the most.  When free.   Moses, aptly named after the Exodus hero and the title The Known World instantly link Jones’s slave with the bible.  To scrutinize a race omitted or to make a place for slaves within.  The verb Known biblically carries various meanings as does the meaning behind the gestures of Moses.  Moses clings repeatedly to the only World he knows.  Nature. Jones begins with the death of Moses’s Master and the routine he binds himself to no matter who is in command.  Moses continues to work well after he ended the day either because of his leadership role on the plantation or the anxiety he understood that will arrive with a new master or he is more at ease working than reclining.  At work Moses feels most free. Once he frees himself from the mule at the end of his fifteen hour day, Moses instantly becomes or still is bound to nature.  His true identity since mankind has forsaken him.  Moses proceeds to look, listen, smell, touch, and taste all aspects of nature surrounding him.  The sunset proves the same for any man no matter the stature and Moses turns to his routine of consuming the land for both spiritual symbolism and his ability to forecast capabilities of the soil.  This talent, maybe the only one Moses either feels is his.  This routine or the routines on the plantation act as the only part of his life Moses feels he controls.  The imagery throughout serves again how any aspect of nature supersedes mankind for Moses.  To list examples to make this paper seem longer I would infuse the “birds” out-chirping the children and the most vivid example, of his “turning away” from his wife and boy in order to go for the “third time that week” to embrace nature and not mankind.  The distance Moses keeps from his family does not come from selfishness but perhaps a fear of being separated soon from wife and boy with the recent death of his master.  Or not.  But anything besides he likes to be alone.   Or just restating what the passage says. Jones offers no dialogue for Moses nor thoughts within (other than prophesies of dirt and rheumatism) and Moses is viewed objectively just as Moses views and Knows the world.  Moses sheds his last links to mankind (clothes) and ceremoniously rests in a patch of woods “no animal would touch” yet Moses finds beauty and reverence in these forsaken woods.  Again, something he feels either equates to his identity (like mule who dutifully followed) or just a place no human inhabited, thus beautiful.  Under a shower of rain Moses lies supine facing the rain his future self and another day and night as a slave.  This torrent of catharsis a final baptismal symbol by Jones or a purification before the next Master’s harness. No other phrase represents Moses better: Believing he was alone, he smiled.\n"}
{"prompt":"Write a paragraph about cruelty in Toni Morrison’s Beloved.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" For the sixty million and more.  Toni Morrison’s epitaph etched on the page before entering 124 Bluestone and the lives of “free” slaves of her novel Beloved is solely in veneration of the cruelty all slaves endured and survived.  Her novel takes place eighteen years after the end of slavery.  A time suggesting celebration and hope.  Yet, for the characters of Beloved, horror.  Though fixated on the lives of slaves from a plantation called Sweet Home, the novel honors slaves who perished on the vessels of middle passage to those literally haunted by the cruelty they suffer.  Morrison’s scope of cruelty and inhumanity speaks for and honors all slaves.   Morrison focuses her tale of slavery around the non-fictional sacrifice of Margaret Garner, a slave who killed her own daughter as an act of protection from the brutality and dehumanization of her slave master.  From this axis, Morrison projects a non-linear, fractured account of the generational plague slaves suffer, endure, and worst of all, remember. Morrison’s purpose? To honor.  To remember.  To incite empathy.  To educate.\n"}
{"prompt":"Write a short essay about Antoine de Saint Exupery’s, The Little Prince\n\n###\n\n","completion":" In an array of planets and asteroids and a desert, the distortions of the French aviator, Antoine de Saint Exupery’s, The Little Prince echoes his plea for not just imagination and creativity, but to cherish with fervor everything close to us.  The Little Prince’s distorted odyssey includes miniature planets with magnanimous metaphors, archetypal evil beings as allies, and commentary on the posthumous existence awaiting us all.  Hopefully. This denizen of the sky, dubbed “Saint Ex” embodied his characters, a dreamer who doodled, wrote poems, and obsessed with the invention of the airplane. He touched the sky as a pilot in the French military, and a pioneer of postal aviation, flew mail in a primitive plane with no radio over the Sahara desert and the Andes Mountains. Saint Ex’s daredevil scrapes with death and heroic rescues of fellow downed pilots were legendary.  No wonder his creation of Le Petit.  The Narrator of the tale symbolizes the downtrodden adult, railing against those who could not see his the beauty of his art.  A boa for a hat for an elephant for it doesn’t really matter.  The idea was that he sought for his art to be defined.  And not until he met The Little Prince in cascades of sand did he realize the best drawing is actually inside a box.  It is left up to THE READER.  Ha!  Just kidding.  Please don’t ever say this again.  Art is best undefined, infinite, intangible.  The mark of imagination.  The unseen. And on to some planets with hyperbolic messages transparent for children and for the “childlike” adult, a chance to pause at each destination for some adult postpartum reflection.  Each, with a “dichotomy” of interpretation.  I hate that word. \n"}
{"prompt":"Write a short paragraph about Albert Camus's The Stranger\n\n###\n\n","completion":" The Stranger is not merely one of the most widely read novels of the 20th century, but one of the books likely to outlive it. Written in 1946, Camus's compelling and troubling tale of a disaffected, apparently amoral young man has earned a durable popularity in part because it reveals so vividly the anxieties of its time. Alienation, the fear of anonymity, spiritual doubt--all could have been given a purely modern inflection in the hands of a lesser talent than Camus, who won the Nobel Prize in 1957 and was noted for his existentialist aesthetic. The remarkable trick of The Stranger, however, is that it's not mired in period philosophy.\n"}
{"prompt":"Write a short paragraph about Herman Hesse's Siddhartha\n\n###\n\n","completion":" Hesse's famous and influential novel, Siddartha, is perhaps the most important and compelling moral allegory our troubled century has produced. Integrating Eastern and Western spiritual traditions with psychoanalysis and philosophy, this strangely simple tale, written with a deep and moving empathy for humanity, has touched the lives of millions since its original publication in 1922. Set in India, Siddhartha is the story of a young Brahmin's search for ultimate reality after meeting with the Buddha. His quest takes him from a life of decadence to asceticism, through the illusory joys of sensual love with a beautiful courtesan, and of wealth and fame, to the painful struggles with his son and the ultimate wisdom of renunciation.\n"}
