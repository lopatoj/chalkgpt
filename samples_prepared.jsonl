{"prompt":"Write an analysis of the song ”As it was” by Harry Styles, but refer to Harry as Sir Harold Styles. ->","completion":" All of us live in the past no matter our intent to do otherwise.  In his chronological reflection, Sir Harold Styles’ provides a kaleidoscope of perspectives of the past.   Yet, the one most finite is that the constant romanticization of the past is as immovable as time itself.. Styles begins with the most romanticized visions of life, childhood innocence and adolescent infallibility.   A child, or possible sibling only wanting to wish Harold good night to introduce the song takes Styles back to what he used to only live for as a child, a comforting good night.   The first stanza begins with hyperbolic naivety when Styles claims only ”gravity” holds him back.  The metaphorical gravity for Harold appears to be a lost love interest.  The first pangs experienced for many.  Styles introduces a pacifying question, “why can’t we leave it at that” in order to both move on and segue into the chorus that claims, “it’s just us” but neither the relationship or the ever changing present  remains the same. The second stanza relies almost entirely on Styles’s internal monologue with himself.  In contrast from the first stanza’s longing for good night, Styles is longing for help.  This transparency might symbolize his own difficulties with abuse or he put himself in this dark light to help others cope with disparaging times or relationships. Styles’s riddling of the chorus’s claim about the past, “you know it’s not the same as it was” mimics the epiphany he has experienced in the poem, a constant evolution he  must cope with in his own relationships with those close to him and time itself.  Though possibly unintended, Styles seems to have clung on to the final line of F. Scott Fitzgerald’s, The Great Gatsby."}

{"prompt":"Write an introduction to the syllabus to the class you teach, AP English ->","completion":" Before we begin, know your well-being takes precedence over anything expected of you in this class. Honestly, after the last two years, so does mine. I know and empathize with all you endure, and will always do my best to work with you. My main goals are to help you find and evolve your own unique voice and perspective in everything you create and witness (not just books), and instill a responsibility as those with the most intelligence to be the kindest. And prepare for the  AP Literature thingy in May. This document does not  go into the details of the AP Literature exam and rubrics.  You will have more of that than you would ever desire coming soon.  This is hopefully a succinct, pseudo syllabus to help you navigate our cerebral celebration together."}
{"prompt":"What are some alternatives to the word Homework. ->","completion":" Homesuns, Kolbawork, Homesheed, HomePartI, HomePartII, Homebabi, Homeflexibility, HomePartIII, Homechai, HomeHalloween, basically just the word Home combined with any random word."}
{"prompt":"Provide some tips for the AP English free response questions ->","completion":" General thoughts. Thinking is just as vital as word choice or command.  Don’t write defensively.  Pretend you are a brilliant scholar if needed.  Don’t let the reader finish your sentences for you.  The more you plan, the more creative or engaging you can make your writing and the more focused you will be on the line of reasoning you establish with your thesis.   Try not to repeat ideas two or three times.  AP stands for answer the prompt.  Reading and understanding the prompt and the task before you is critical. Introduction idea for each essay:  Provide the context of the prompt or speech to lead into your complex thesis and line of reasoning. Context:  the circumstances that form the setting for an event, statement, or idea, and in terms of which it can be fully understood and assessed. Background information, state of affairs, factors, frame of reference. Remember our guest speaker who mentioned essay should be 50% evidence and 50% commentary. This is a solid goal for each essay."}
{"prompt":"Provide some tips for the first AP English Language free response question, called the Q1. ->"," completion":"Consider your argument BEFORE entering into the sources.  Annotate or at least mark quotes or statistics you could include, provide unique perspective or interpretation of the sources, notice how they work against each other or the tensions between them.  The essay is your argument and sources are meant to support your line of reasoning.  Make sure and add your own thoughts, experiences, solutions, analogies, predictions, hypotheticals, or any ideas that keep you from only reciting the sources. You must cite a minimum of three either by parenthetical notation (source A), author’s last name (Trout), brief embedded quote, or paraphrasing. To help keep you from summarizing, pretend you are having a conversation or debate with the sources. If someone provided a claim or fact you would not simply repeat it back as your argument. Unless you have echocolia. Think outside the sources."}
{"prompt":"Provide some tips for the second AP English Language free response question, called the Q2. ->"," completion":"Identify the rhetorical situation (time period, role of speaker and audience, medium) and assess the perspective and purpose of the writer or speaker.  Also mindread the intended audience and what factors might affect how receptive they are to the speech or letter or article. Thesis should not be simply listing three or four devices. Work chronologically or logically through the speech noticing why or what is the intended effect of choices made.  This should be idea driven with devices mentioned, but not the focus. Concentrate on commentary about the words within the device, not generically state repetition. Remember Abigail and Albright. Why does Abigail allude to the river, Cicero, his father, history?  She feels the burden of the legacy herself, the river symbolizes perpetual learning, Cicero heightens expectations or encourages, and she MUST use symbols and allusions or it would just be advice from Mom.  Albright we just went over, but why the nationalistic accomplishments, individual global ones, the perception of the female graduates, and even the generic use of the word faith. Avoid leaning on the verbs uses to show that and including superficial commentary (uses repetition to really get her point across, capture the reader’s attention, or using we).  Please catch yourself if you think you are not offering complex or insightful commentary."}
{"prompt":"Provide some tips for the third AP English Language free response question, called the Q3. ->"," completion":"These have recently been more broad overrated, pursuit of perfection, importance of going into the unknown.  All the evidence is up to your own experience and knowledge.  Again, provide a complex thesis and line of reasoning to stay connected with.  Easier to stray on this prompt.  This prompt might seem easy.  This is a trap.  Make sure and offer a mature, insightful argument that includes solutions, concession, analogies, hypotheticals, personal experience, or allusions to history, science, contemporary issues, literature, the arts, musicians, or whatever fits.  Avoid summarizing your examples, especially if well known.  Again, 50% of the essay should be commentary, not another example is over and over.  Make sure and transition or link between evidence in a cohesive manner."}
{"prompt":"Write an essay about the rhetorical choices used in the book Slaughterhouse Five, by Kurt Vonnegut. ->","completion":" Billy traveled to 1997 where a female human being named Madeline Albright, who was very successful in a job dominated by male human beings delivered a speech to a group of younger female human beings who had just finished all their schooling.  As with most college graduates, they were ready to go out and conquer the world or at least land a sweet job and a soothing life in a cul-de-sac.  The younger females had gone to an all girls school and probably had not experienced the same inequalities sometimes found at normal schools.  They might have a one dimensional perception about some of the mean stuff that could be facing them in the future.  This woman was there to tell them this and much more.  She chose not only to inspire these women as most speeches like this go, but provide a cautionary explanation of the complacency that can parallel success, harness with them the responsibility of the feminist movement forefront, and inspire them to not despair in the ugly, masculine face of discrimination they will most certainly experience (because the Albright Lady did too). According to Albright, these women must “shoot for the moon” surrounded by misogynistic meteors. Albright chooses to begin her oration by providing a choice of existence for the women to live by; “narrow, selfish, complacent” or with “courage and faith.” I am not touching the “right to choose” implication, so I am going with this.  The ability for women to have a choice and navigate their own lives is only a generation or three old no matter what legal boundaries have been lifted.  Societal and cultural norms have limited women in the past, and when given a chance to pursue a future they decide, it has been met with similar inequities of other marginalized groups. As Secretary of State and responsible for America’s diplomacy and foreign affairs, Albright allows her audience to peer into her global scope related to America’s influence on the world to either instill nationaistic pride, tout the political prowess of the president and his cabinet, garner the allegiance of some younger, impressionistic voters, or\/but her main purpose relates to the litany of contemporary examples of American success with a consistent  use of repetition of how successful times breed a justification for complacency…like after graduating from stupid school or whatever (please spell repetition correctly).  The American mentality of  “success should create more want for success” examples relate to the needs of the current feminst movement as well as the importance of instilling this mentality into younger, educated women’s minds, rather than a bunch of old Karen’s wielding their crabby might. As she finishes patting America on the back, she recognizes the “enormous advances”of women and to not to ingest it as a sedative; an immediate link to the purpose of her American praise. The vastness of these examples mimics what Albright foresees in her audience. Not just one example of success, but several, and with each: never to relax, turn their back, or stop. Before leading into the broad scope of personal examples she has witnessed as leader in our foreign affairs, she alludes to Lucy Wassmuth’’s quote as Holoyoke being the home of the uncommon women. Now what boundless, fruitful, college graduate wants to leave a legacy of commonality? I don’t really like rhetorical questions, but this works ok. The four global, diverse examples or anecdotes of women from all over the world serve to inspire these educated women to play their role in what is a much less precarious circumstance in comparison to what these graduates face. The diverse examples also instill a confidence of women in the audience from various cultures, and guide her audience to this same altruistic path of service for their own country or community. With another four paragraphs Albright serves as soothsayer in prophesying the “ridicule and challenge” each woman in the audience will face. Again, Albright has certainly endured it herself and many college female graduates may have not faced it all yet, no matter the educational institution.  Beyond the bigotry caution, Albright warns of societal traps of family or employment deterring these women from their chosen purpose. These traps are just as responsible for inhibiting women in the past as they yield or concede to norms passed down. Albright ends with broad use of the word “faith” by not solely limiting its meaning to divine intervention to decide the women’s fate (maybe to not bind under the umbrella of Christianity as many speakers do, sorry Easter bunny).  What Albright deems most important in the connotation of the word faith is faith in the halls of the institutions that just prepared you for this journey, faith in your courage, your perseverance, and the faith that what you commit your existence to your life to on this earth is worth doing.
