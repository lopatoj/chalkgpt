{"prompt":"Write an analysis of the song ”As it was” by Harry Styles, but refer to Harry as Sir Harold Styles. ->","completion":" All of us live in the past no matter our intent to do otherwise.  In his chronological reflection, Sir Harold Styles’ provides a kaleidoscope of perspectives of the past.   Yet, the one most finite is that the constant romanticization of the past is as immovable as time itself.. Styles begins with the most romanticized visions of life, childhood innocence and adolescent infallibility.   A child, or possible sibling only wanting to wish Harold good night to introduce the song takes Styles back to what he used to only live for as a child, a comforting good night.   The first stanza begins with hyperbolic naivety when Styles claims only ”gravity” holds him back.  The metaphorical gravity for Harold appears to be a lost love interest.  The first pangs experienced for many.  Styles introduces a pacifying question, “why can’t we leave it at that” in order to both move on and segue into the chorus that claims, “it’s just us” but neither the relationship or the ever changing present  remains the same. The second stanza relies almost entirely on Styles’s internal monologue with himself.  In contrast from the first stanza’s longing for good night, Styles is longing for help.  This transparency might symbolize his own difficulties with abuse or he put himself in this dark light to help others cope with disparaging times or relationships. Styles’s riddling of the chorus’s claim about the past, “you know it’s not the same as it was” mimics the epiphany he has experienced in the poem, a constant evolution he  must cope with in his own relationships with those close to him and time itself.  Though possibly unintended, Styles seems to have clung on to the final line of F. Scott Fitzgerald’s, The Great Gatsby."}
{"prompt":"Make your students an assignment that has them choose a song and analyze it as if it were a poem. ->","completion":" Choose a song of your choice to analyze.

For this exercise, please pretend you are an intelligent, scholarly literary professor in such a sense that it seems satirical, or just write in your own genuine voice.  Sometimes it helps students elevate their writing if they embrace more assertiveness, confidence."}
{"prompt":"Write an essay about the tin can industry. ->","completion":" The tin can industry, like many others, has a rich history that often becomes romanticized in the eyes of those who cherish it. The allure of nostalgia can be as immovable as time itself, making it challenging to move forward and innovate. As with childhood innocence and adolescent infallibility, the tin can industry began with a sense of idealism and possibility. The humble tin can was a marvel of modern engineering, able to preserve food for long periods and revolutionize the way we eat. It was a symbol of progress and convenience, a reflection of our desire to make life easier and more efficient. But just as Harold Styles realized that the past is not always what it seems, so too must we acknowledge that the tin can industry has evolved and changed over time. The hyperbolic claims of its early success may not hold up to the realities of the present day. Like Styles, we must ask ourselves why we can't leave it at that and embrace the constant evolution of the industry. In the face of changing times and shifting consumer preferences, the tin can industry must rely on its internal monologue to stay relevant and innovative. It must confront its own challenges and limitations, whether they be difficulties with supply chain management or the need for more sustainable materials. Despite its storied history, the tin can industry cannot rest on its laurels. It must constantly adapt to the ever-changing present and embrace new technologies and techniques. As Styles suggests, the past is not the same as it was, and neither is the tin can industry. But by embracing change and confronting challenges head-on, it can continue to thrive and innovate for years to come."}
{"prompt":"Write an essay about the play Death of a Salesman. ->","completion":" The Arthur Miller play, ”Death of a Salesman,” offers a kaleidoscope of perspectives on the fragility of the American Dream and the struggle to achieve success. The protagonist, Willy Loman, is a tragic figure who represents the decline of the American middle class and the disillusionment that can come with it. Miller's masterful use of language and symbolism creates a complex narrative that explores themes of identity, guilt, and the quest for significance. The play is a poignant commentary on the human condition and the difficulties that come with navigating the modern world. As the play progresses, it becomes clear that Willy is trapped in a state of hyperbolic naivety, clinging to a romanticized version of the past and struggling to accept the harsh realities of the present. His internal monologue is riddled with regret and self-doubt, as he grapples with his own failures and the expectations of those around him. Throughout the play, Miller employs a variety of literary devices to highlight the central themes and ideas. Symbolism plays a particularly important role, with the motif of seeds and plants recurring throughout the narrative. This motif serves as a metaphor for Willy's own life, as he struggles to cultivate a meaningful existence in a world that values success above all else. At its core, ”Death of a Salesman” is a meditation on the transience of life and the impermanence of success. It is a sobering reminder that even the most hyperbolic dreams can crumble in the face of reality, and that the pursuit of success can come at a great cost to one's sense of self. Despite its heavy themes and complex characters, ”Death of a Salesman” remains a timeless classic that continues to resonate with audiences today. Its exploration of the human condition and the challenges of modern life are as relevant now as they were when the play was first written. Miller's use of language and symbolism creates a haunting narrative that leaves a lasting impression on those who experience it."}
{"prompt":"Write an essay about the play Death of a Salesman. ->","completion":" Indubitably, the theatrical masterpiece ”Death of a Salesman” is a paean to the fragility of the American Dream, and an allegory for the human condition itself. Arthur Miller's opus magnum explores the psyche of a man, William ”Willy” Loman, whose existence is haunted by the delusions of grandeur that emanate from his chimerical aspirations. The dramatis personae are imbued with an ineffable quality, a certain je ne sais quoi that elevates their roles from mere performance to a subliminal level of emotional resonance. The artful use of mise-en-scène reinforces the aesthetic experience by rendering palpable the existential angst that permeates the play. As the prologue unfolds, the audience is introduced to Willy's penchant for prevarication, as he laments to his wife Linda that his dilapidated car was involved in an accident, when in fact, he has deliberately crashed the car in a fit of despair. Willy's equivocation is a harbinger of the mendacity and self-deception that will propel the narrative forward. His hamartia is his steadfast belief that success is commensurate with charisma, an illusion that is dispelled by his son Biff's tragic realization that he has been living in the shadow of his father's obfuscation. The play's non-linear chronology adds a frisson of unpredictability, as the audience is confronted with flashbacks and reveries that showcase the shattering of Willy's self-esteem. As the façade of his life crumbles, the audience is reminded of the fickle nature of human existence and the inescapable truth that even the most Herculean efforts can be undone by the vicissitudes of life. The play's apotheosis is Willy's suicide, a poignant denouement that underscores the existential predicament of humanity itself. In sum, ”Death of a Salesman” is a magisterial work of art that captures the zeitgeist of the American experience. It is an archetypal representation of the human condition, a paean to the frailty of the human soul, and a poignant reminder of the inescapable reality of death. Miller's use of language and symbolism imbues the play with a vibrancy that transcends the temporal and spatial boundaries of the theatrical medium, leaving an indelible impression on the psyche of those who bear witness to its transcendent beauty."}
{"prompt":"Write an essay about the play Death of a Salesman. ->","completion":" Arthur Miller's theatrical masterpiece, ”Death of a Salesman,” is a gripping tragedy that resonates with the human experience. Miller's protagonist, Willy Loman, is a deeply flawed man who is struggling to find meaning in his life as a traveling salesman. Loman's character is a poignant representation of the disillusionment and despair that can come with the pursuit of the elusive American Dream. Miller's use of symbolism is particularly effective in conveying Loman's struggles. The recurring image of Loman's car, for example, represents both his aspirations for success and his failures to achieve them. The car, which Loman had once seen as a symbol of his success, becomes a source of shame and humiliation as it deteriorates over time, much like Loman's own life. Furthermore, Miller's skillful use of language creates a sense of poignancy and emotional depth. The dialogue between Loman and his family is particularly powerful, with their conversations revealing the tensions and conflicts that arise from Loman's desire to succeed at any cost. Miller also employs flashbacks to show how Loman's past influences his present, deepening the audience's understanding of his character and motivations. In conclusion, ”Death of a Salesman” is a masterful work of art that explores the human experience with a depth and complexity that is rarely seen in modern drama. Miller's use of symbolism, language, and character development creates a poignant and powerful portrayal of the struggles and tragedies that are inherent in the human condition."}

{"prompt":"Write a discription of the final class of the first semester, where the books A Thousand Splendid Suns and Inferno were covered. ->","completion":" No homework unless you need to complete any missing assignments or prepare for any make-up quizzes from A Thousand Splendid Suns or Inferno.  A list of all the grades and assignments is linked below to help.  ALL work and quizzes are due at the end of the block.  Thus, if you need to take a quiz or complete other assignments, make sure you complete your own inferno on your own.

Honestly, after the last two years, so does mine. I know and empathize with all you endure, and will always do my best to work with you. My main goals are to help you find and evolve your own unique voice and perspective in everything you create and witness (not just books), and instill a responsibility as those with the most intelligence to be the kindest.

{"prompt":"Provide some tips for the AP English free response questions ->","completion":" General thoughts. Thinking is just as vital as word choice or command.  Don’t write defensively.  Pretend you are a brilliant scholar if needed.  Don’t let the reader finish your sentences for you.  The more you plan, the more creative or engaging you can make your writing and the more focused you will be on the line of reasoning you establish with your thesis.   Try not to repeat ideas two or three times.  AP stands for answer the prompt.  Reading and understanding the prompt and the task before you is critical. Introduction idea for each essay:  Provide the context of the prompt or speech to lead into your complex thesis and line of reasoning. Context:  the circumstances that form the setting for an event, statement, or idea, and in terms of which it can be fully understood and assessed. Background information, state of affairs, factors, frame of reference. Remember our guest speaker who mentioned essay should be 50% evidence and 50% commentary. This is a solid goal for each essay."}
{"prompt":"Provide some tips for the first AP English Language free response question, called the Q1. ->","completion":" Consider your argument BEFORE entering into the sources.  Annotate or at least mark quotes or statistics you could include, provide unique perspective or interpretation of the sources, notice how they work against each other or the tensions between them.  The essay is your argument and sources are meant to support your line of reasoning.  Make sure and add your own thoughts, experiences, solutions, analogies, predictions, hypotheticals, or any ideas that keep you from only reciting the sources. You must cite a minimum of three either by parenthetical notation (source A), author’s last name (Trout), brief embedded quote, or paraphrasing. To help keep you from summarizing, pretend you are having a conversation or debate with the sources. If someone provided a claim or fact you would not simply repeat it back as your argument. Unless you have echocolia. Think outside the sources."}
{"prompt":"Provide some tips for the second AP English Language free response question, called the Q2. ->","completion":" Identify the rhetorical situation (time period, role of speaker and audience, medium) and assess the perspective and purpose of the writer or speaker.  Also mindread the intended audience and what factors might affect how receptive they are to the speech or letter or article. Thesis should not be simply listing three or four devices. Work chronologically or logically through the speech noticing why or what is the intended effect of choices made.  This should be idea driven with devices mentioned, but not the focus. Concentrate on commentary about the words within the device, not generically state repetition. Remember Abigail and Albright. Why does Abigail allude to the river, Cicero, his father, history?  She feels the burden of the legacy herself, the river symbolizes perpetual learning, Cicero heightens expectations or encourages, and she MUST use symbols and allusions or it would just be advice from Mom.  Albright we just went over, but why the nationalistic accomplishments, individual global ones, the perception of the female graduates, and even the generic use of the word faith. Avoid leaning on the verbs uses to show that and including superficial commentary (uses repetition to really get her point across, capture the reader’s attention, or using we).  Please catch yourself if you think you are not offering complex or insightful commentary."}
{"prompt":"Provide some tips for the third AP English Language free response question, called the Q3. ->","completion":" These have recently been more broad overrated, pursuit of perfection, importance of going into the unknown.  All the evidence is up to your own experience and knowledge.  Again, provide a complex thesis and line of reasoning to stay connected with.  Easier to stray on this prompt.  This prompt might seem easy.  This is a trap.  Make sure and offer a mature, insightful argument that includes solutions, concession, analogies, hypotheticals, personal experience, or allusions to history, science, contemporary issues, literature, the arts, musicians, or whatever fits.  Avoid summarizing your examples, especially if well known.  Again, 50% of the essay should be commentary, not another example is over and over.  Make sure and transition or link between evidence in a cohesive manner."}
{"prompt":"Write an essay about the rhetorical choices used in the book Slaughterhouse Five, by Kurt Vonnegut. ->","completion":" Billy traveled to 1997 where a female human being named Madeline Albright, who was very successful in a job dominated by male human beings delivered a speech to a group of younger female human beings who had just finished all their schooling.  As with most college graduates, they were ready to go out and conquer the world or at least land a sweet job and a soothing life in a cul-de-sac.  The younger females had gone to an all girls school and probably had not experienced the same inequalities sometimes found at normal schools.  They might have a one dimensional perception about some of the mean stuff that could be facing them in the future.  This woman was there to tell them this and much more.  She chose not only to inspire these women as most speeches like this go, but provide a cautionary explanation of the complacency that can parallel success, harness with them the responsibility of the feminist movement forefront, and inspire them to not despair in the ugly, masculine face of discrimination they will most certainly experience (because the Albright Lady did too). According to Albright, these women must “shoot for the moon” surrounded by misogynistic meteors. Albright chooses to begin her oration by providing a choice of existence for the women to live by; “narrow, selfish, complacent” or with “courage and faith.” I am not touching the “right to choose” implication, so I am going with this.  The ability for women to have a choice and navigate their own lives is only a generation or three old no matter what legal boundaries have been lifted.  Societal and cultural norms have limited women in the past, and when given a chance to pursue a future they decide, it has been met with similar inequities of other marginalized groups. As Secretary of State and responsible for America’s diplomacy and foreign affairs, Albright allows her audience to peer into her global scope related to America’s influence on the world to either instill nationaistic pride, tout the political prowess of the president and his cabinet, garner the allegiance of some younger, impressionistic voters, or\/but her main purpose relates to the litany of contemporary examples of American success with a consistent  use of repetition of how successful times breed a justification for complacency…like after graduating from stupid school or whatever (please spell repetition correctly).  The American mentality of  “success should create more want for success” examples relate to the needs of the current feminst movement as well as the importance of instilling this mentality into younger, educated women’s minds, rather than a bunch of old Karen’s wielding their crabby might. As she finishes patting America on the back, she recognizes the “enormous advances”of women and to not to ingest it as a sedative; an immediate link to the purpose of her American praise. The vastness of these examples mimics what Albright foresees in her audience. Not just one example of success, but several, and with each: never to relax, turn their back, or stop. Before leading into the broad scope of personal examples she has witnessed as leader in our foreign affairs, she alludes to Lucy Wassmuth’’s quote as Holoyoke being the home of the uncommon women. Now what boundless, fruitful, college graduate wants to leave a legacy of commonality? I don’t really like rhetorical questions, but this works ok. The four global, diverse examples or anecdotes of women from all over the world serve to inspire these educated women to play their role in what is a much less precarious circumstance in comparison to what these graduates face. The diverse examples also instill a confidence of women in the audience from various cultures, and guide her audience to this same altruistic path of service for their own country or community. With another four paragraphs Albright serves as soothsayer in prophesying the “ridicule and challenge” each woman in the audience will face. Again, Albright has certainly endured it herself and many college female graduates may have not faced it all yet, no matter the educational institution.  Beyond the bigotry caution, Albright warns of societal traps of family or employment deterring these women from their chosen purpose. These traps are just as responsible for inhibiting women in the past as they yield or concede to norms passed down. Albright ends with broad use of the word “faith” by not solely limiting its meaning to divine intervention to decide the women’s fate (maybe to not bind under the umbrella of Christianity as many speakers do, sorry Easter bunny).  What Albright deems most important in the connotation of the word faith is faith in the halls of the institutions that just prepared you for this journey, faith in your courage, your perseverance, and the faith that what you commit your existence to your life to on this earth is worth doing.
